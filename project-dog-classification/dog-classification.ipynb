You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! \n\n> **Note**: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission.\n\nIn addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n\n>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut.  Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.\n\nThe rubric contains _optional_ \"Stand Out Suggestions\" for enhancing the project beyond the minimum requirements. If you decide to pursue the \"Stand Out Suggestions\", you should include the code in this Jupyter notebook.\n\n\n\n---\n### Why We're Here \n\nIn this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). \n\n![Sample Dog Output](images/sample_dog_output.png)\n\nIn this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!\n\n### The Road Ahead\n\nWe break the notebook into separate steps.

In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%.  In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.\n\nWe mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  \n\nBrittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel\n- | - \n<img src=\"images/Brittany_02625.jpg\" width=\"100\"> | <img src=\"images/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n\nIt is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  \n\nCurly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel\n- | -\n<img src=\"images/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg\" width=\"200\"> | <img src=\"images/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n\n\nLikewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  \n\nYellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador\n- | -\n<img src=\"images/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg\" width=\"150\"> | <img src=\"images/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg\" width=\"240\"> | <img src=\"images/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg\" width=\"220\">\n\nWe also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  \n\nRemember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.  And, of course, have fun!\n\n### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset\n\nUse the code cell below to write three separate [data loaders](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at `dogImages/train`, `dogImages/valid`, and `dogImages/test`, respectively).  You may find [this documentation on custom datasets](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html) to be a useful resource.
